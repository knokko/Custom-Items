/**
 * <p>
 * Represents the boolean representation of a custom item. This is the data that was
 * generated by the Editor when the custom item was exported. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * To elaborate, take a look at the export(BitOutput) method of the CustomItem class 
 * of the Editor. All custom items will export themselves by writing primitives 
 * (int, String, boolean...) to the given BitOutput instance and BitOutput will 
 * convert all those to a sequence of booleans. This class represents such a sequence 
 * of booleans.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The most interesting part of the boolean representation is that it can be used to
 * recreate the custom item, even from previous versions of the item set.
 * </p>
